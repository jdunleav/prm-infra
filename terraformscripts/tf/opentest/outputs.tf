# This is a cause for errors when a destroy is issued twice (or when the resource in the module have not been created in the previous apply command run).
# The bug is reported here https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/18026 and the resolution is to set the environment variable TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS=1 .
# Another workaround is the one expkicited in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9543 and http://67bricks.com/blog/?p=85 , but it won't work as 
# modules don't have the count property and therefore don't support the splat syntax.
